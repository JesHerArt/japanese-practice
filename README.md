# japanese-practice
Simple javascript web game to go through the romaji characters representing both hiragana and katakana as flash cards. On your own dry erase board (or paper) you write down the hiragana or katakana character (or both, if you want to be extreme) to be able to practice your memorization at writing in Japanese. Made responsive for on the go studying.
